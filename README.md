## Project Motivation and Goals

This project is a personal initiative to build a dynamic Weather Application using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, aimed at sharpening my JavaScript and web development skills. Leveraging Next.js, the app will incorporate features like server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for optimal performance and SEO-friendliness, while Tailwind CSS will ensure a sleek, responsive design with utility-first styling.

Through this project, I aim to deepen my understanding of API integration, responsive design principles, and modern web development workflows. This Weather App serves as both a learning opportunity and a portfolio piece to showcase my ability to create practical, visually appealing, and user-friendly applications with cutting-edge tools.

## Getting Started

Navigate to the cloned folder.
